As of 2025, the book has been translated into eight languages, and has now been viewed by 850,000 people.\nApplied Epi’s founders established the organization to build on the success of the Epi R Handbook, broadening its mission to strengthen applied epidemiology worldwide through methodological training, technical support, and fostering a global community."
